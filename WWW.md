## Introduction

[TheWebConf Conference](https://thewebconf.org/) was first conceived in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. The first conference of the series, WWW1, was held at CERN in 1994 and organized by Robert Cailliau.

The International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2) was founded by Joseph Hardin and Robert Cailliau later in 1994 and has been responsible for the conference series ever since. Except for 1994 and 1995 when two conferences were held each year, WWW became an annual event held in April or May. The location of the conference rotates among America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. In 2001 the conference designator changed from a number (1 through 10) to the year it is held; i.e., WWW11 became known as WWW2002, and so on.

Starting in 2018, The brand of the conference has been changed and the series is now named The Web Conference or in brief TheWebConf and starting in 2022, the conference became an ACM/SIGWEB event and the rotation between the three geographical areas is no longer the rule.

In 2022 the IW3C2 adopted new by-laws and it is no longer involved in the organization of the TheWebConf. Its new mission is to manage funds from gifts or donations to grant awards for publications presented during these conferences.
